## Simple "hello" App

### Running the project locally

If you want to test the project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Check current status of IC blockchain and our connection to it
dfx ping ic

# Starts the execution environement (dfinity blockchain replica)
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy

# Start frontent development server at http://localhost:8080
npm start

# Stop local network replica
dfx stop
```

### Interacting with the app
To interact with the deployed application you can try the following command, where `hello_backend` is the name of the canister, `greet` is one of its functions and `everyone` is the parameter we pass to it. See canister code [here](./src/hello_backend/main.mo).

```bash
dfx canister call hello_backend greet everyone
```

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
